## How to use this repository

To read most of the content, you need to use Jupyter Notebook. You can have it installed via Anaconda or pip.

```bash
pip install jupyterlab
```

There are two main ways you can follow:

1. **Browse the repository directly**: You can navigate through the folders and files to find topics that interest you. This repo uses submodules to include content from my other repositories, so you can follow instructions in the README files of those submodules for more details.
2. **Clone the repository with submodules**: If you want to have a local copy of the entire repository including all submodules, you can clone it using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/awcest/dumpo 
   ```

   Then you can either start from the `Summary.ipynb` (`jupyter notebook Summary.ipynb`) file to get an overview of the contents or navigate through the folders as you prefer (with `jupyter notebook` only).
